# XERO New Invoicing CSS Override

This is a Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey script to override the new CSS style on Xero.com accounting system.

I had a need for this as the new invoicing layout uses a lot of padding on tables making it look HUGE and not efficient.

Here is a screenshot of how it looks before and after
